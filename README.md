# Ornithological-App
This MyLINONYANA App is a web-based app developed in Lesotho using the R Shiny framework. Shiny apps are interactive web applications that are built with the R programming language.
The shiny framework is ideal for creating a wide variety of dynamic documents, interactive applications such as decision data dashboards, interactive visualizations, and machine learning models.
With the advancements in technology and data analysis tools, it has become easier than ever to explore and visualize bird data.
One such tool is the R web app, which allows users to create interactive graphs and visualizations based on bird data. 
By using the R web app for bird data visualizations, birdwatching enthusiasts can gain valuable insights into various aspects of avian behavior and population trends.
They can analyze migration patterns, track species diversity over time, and even study the impact of environmental factors on bird populations.
The interactive graphs generated by the R web app enable users to explore the data in a dynamic way. With its user-friendly interface and powerful analytical capabilities, the R web app is a valuable tool for both amateur and professional birdwatchers alike. 
It provides a platform for sharing observations and findings with fellow enthusiasts, contributing to a better understanding of avian ecology.

This app uses bird species data acquired from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility(GBIF). It shows bird species sightings in Lesotho.
This app has been developed for taxonomists, nature conservationists, environmentalists, environmental scientists, bird enthusiasts, bird watchers, ornithologists, environmental impact assessors, and anyone interested in citizen bird science.
The robustness of this app depends on the quality indicators of GBIF datasets. It is up to us to make use of this open-source tool to improve our decision-making in various sectors.
In conclusion, utilizing an R web app for bird data visualizations opens up new avenues for studying birds and their habitats.
 It empowers users with tools to delve deeper into their passion for ornithology while promoting collaboration within the community of birdwatching enthusiasts.
